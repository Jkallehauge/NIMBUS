# NIMBUS
National Interdisciplinary Network for Quality Assurance of MR images in Radiotherapy (NIMBUS)

This repository is under contruction. It is thought as a gateway to collaborate and share experience between MR-RT scanner-sites within the NIMBUS group. The low level approach is to have a easy platform to exchange examcards/"MR sequence recipies" with track changes. First step is to gather all clinical relevant examcards in this repository.

the structure is so far as follows 
Examcard
*  institute
    -  vendor
        - fieldstrength
            - Anatomical site
